# Week 2: JavaScript Basics

## Goal
Make things interactive. Add behavior to your designs (like Figma prototypes but real!)

## ⚠️ Reality Check
This week might feel harder. JavaScript is where "coding" really starts. First 3 days are hardest - it clicks by Day 4-5. Push through!

## Schedule
- **Day 1-2:** Add interactivity to Week 1 sites
- **Day 3-4:** Build a calculator
- **Day 5-6:** Interactive quiz app
- **Day 7:** To-do list with localStorage

## Figma → JavaScript Translations

| Figma | JavaScript |
|-------|------------|
| Interactive component | Event listener |
| Button hover state | `addEventListener('click')` |
| Variant switching | Changing classes/state |
| Prototype "On click" | `button.addEventListener('click', fn)` |
| Conditional logic | `if/else` statements |

## When Stuck (You Will Be)
- Ask Claude Code your specific error
- Use `console.log()` everywhere
- Re-watch video sections (JS needs repetition)
- Take breaks - your brain is processing!
