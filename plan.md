# 12-Week Learning Plan: Product Designer → Product Builder

**Timeline:** 3 Months (12 weeks)
**Commitment:** 20-30 hours/week (240-360 total hours)
**Goal:** Transform from product designer (Figma expert) to product builder who can code

---

## Your Advantages

✅ Figma power user (components, variants, auto-layout, variables)
✅ Design systems expertise
✅ Component thinking (this = React!)
✅ User-centric mindset
✅ Basic HTML/CSS knowledge

**Key insight:** You already think like a developer. Your Figma knowledge maps directly to code concepts.

## Figma → Code Translation (Your Superpower)

| Figma Concept | Code Equivalent |
|---|---|
| Component | React component (`function Button() {}`) |
| Component properties | Props (`<Button disabled={true} />`) |
| Variants | State & conditional rendering |
| Auto-layout | CSS Flexbox / CSS Grid |
| Instance swap | Component composition |
| Design tokens | CSS variables / Tailwind classes |
| Fill/Stroke | CSS `background-color` / `border` |
| Padding/margin | CSS `padding` / `margin` |

## When You Get Stuck

### Week 2-3: "JavaScript feels too hard"
**This is NORMAL.** Most designers struggle here.
- Solution: Slow down, do more practice
- Use `console.log()` everywhere
- Repeat videos at 0.75x speed
- Take breaks - your brain is processing
- Remember: Senior devs Google syntax too

### Code Errors
1. Read error message carefully
2. Google: "[error message] react next.js"
3. Check Stack Overflow
4. Ask Claude Code (explain what's happening)
5. Check official documentation

### Feeling Overwhelmed
- Take a break (seriously)
- Build something fun, not from the plan
- Watch Fireship 10-min video (funny & informative)
- Extend timeline - strong foundation > rushing
- Remember your "why"

---

## Adjusting the Plan

### If Behind Schedule
- Extend Phase 1 by 1-2 weeks (stronger foundation is better)
- Focus on web apps only (skip mobile for now)
- Use more templates/starters
- Build 2 products instead of 3 in Phase 3

### If Ahead of Schedule
- Add React Native (mobile apps)
- Learn TypeScript (better code quality)
- Add testing (Jest, Playwright)
- Contribute to open source
- Build more complex features

### If Struggling
- **Common:** Week 2-3 JavaScript is hard (NORMAL!)
- **Your advantage:** Design skills most developers don't have
- **Strategy:** Build visually impressive projects from day 1
- **Leverage:** Your design thinking + coding = unicorn builder

---

## Applying Skills at Your Current Job

### Week 2+: Build Internal Tools
- Design system documentation site
- Component library showcase
- Internal dashboard mockup
- Style guide pages

### Week 6+: Prototype with Real Data
- Build clickable prototypes with actual API data
- Demo to stakeholders before engineering
- Validate ideas faster
- Bridge design-engineering gap

### Week 10+: Speak Technical Language
- "I built a working prototype, let me show you"
- "I tested this with the API, here's what's possible"
- "I can code this design system myself"
- "Here's the technical approach for this feature"

### Career Win
- You'll level up your current role significantly
- Engineers will respect your understanding
- You'll ship prototypes, not just designs
- You'll validate ideas faster
- You might even build side products!

---

## Your Reality Check

### 3-Month Outcome (Not a Senior Engineer, But...)
- ✅ You WILL build functional products
- ✅ You WILL prototype ideas independently
- ✅ You WILL speak technical language fluently
- ✅ You WILL level up your current role significantly
- ✅ You WILL ship 2-3 real products
- ✅ You WILL understand engineering constraints

---

## Remember This

**Your Advantage:** You understand users, design systems, and product thinking. Most developers don't.

**Designer + Developer = Unicorn**

You'll build better products than most engineers because you understand the "why" behind features.

---

## Principles for Success

- **Consistency > Intensity** - Show up every day
- **Building > Tutorials** - Build more, watch less
- **Shipping > Perfection** - Done is better than perfect
- **Public > Private** - Learn in public, build community
- **Questions > Silence** - Ask Claude Code anything
- **Repetition > Passive learning** - Code along, don't just watch

---

## Let's Build! 🚀

**Next step:** Go to `week-01-html-css/README.md` and start Day 1.

You have:
- ✅ Design thinking from Figma
- ✅ Component understanding
- ✅ User empathy
- ✅ A clear 12-week plan
- ✅ Claude Code as your pair programmer
- ✅ Everything you need

**The only thing missing is starting.**

Let's ship products! 🚀
