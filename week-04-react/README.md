# Week 4: React - Component Thinking

## Goal
THIS IS YOUR SUPERPOWER WEEK! React components = Figma components in code

## Why You'll Love React
- React components = Figma components
- Props = Component properties
- State = Variants/interactions
- **You already think in components!**

## Schedule
- **Day 1-2:** Convert Week 3 project to React
- **Day 3-4:** Filterable product gallery
- **Day 5-6:** Multi-step form wizard
- **Day 7:** Simple dashboard

## Figma → React Direct Translation

| Figma | React |
|-------|-------|
| Component | `function Button() {...}` |
| Component property (boolean) | `<Button disabled={true} />` |
| Variant | Props: `<Button variant="primary" />` |
| Instance swap | Pass component as prop |
| Component state | `useState()` hook |
| Auto-layout children | `{children}` in component |
| Design tokens | CSS variables/Tailwind |

## Projects

### Project 1: Convert to React (Days 1-2)
- [ ] Pick your Week 3 weather app
- [ ] Break into components: SearchBar, WeatherCard, LoadingSpinner
- [ ] Learn component thinking
- [ ] Ask Claude Code: "Help me break this into React components"

### Project 2: Filterable Gallery (Days 3-4)
- [ ] Product cards (component)
- [ ] Filter buttons (component)
- [ ] Search bar (component)
- [ ] Practice props and state
- [ ] Use fake data or API

### Project 3: Multi-Step Form (Days 5-6)
- [ ] Step 1: Personal info
- [ ] Step 2: Address
- [ ] Step 3: Confirmation
- [ ] Progress indicator
- [ ] Teach state management across components

### Project 4: Dashboard (Day 7)
- [ ] Charts using Chart.js library
- [ ] Multiple widgets (components!)
- [ ] Side navigation
- [ ] **Portfolio-worthy!**

## Key Concepts
- Components as functions
- Props (passing data to components)
- State with `useState()`
- useEffect hook (side effects)
- Conditional rendering
- Lists and keys

## Phase 1 Checkpoint (End of Week 4)
- [ ] Built 14+ projects and deployed them
- [ ] Comfortable with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React
- [ ] Can debug common errors independently
- [ ] Have GitHub profile with activity
- [ ] Shared 4 public posts about your journey
- [ ] Applied learning at work (even small things)

## When Stuck
- Ask Claude Code: "Explain React state using Figma properties"
- Re-watch hook videos (useState, useEffect need repetition)
- Think: "How would I build this in Figma?" Then code it

## Public Post Template
"Week 4: React finally clicked! Built a dashboard with reusable components. As a designer, component thinking feels so natural. [screenshot] ⚛️"

## Buddy Check-In
- Show your best Week 4 project
- What was hardest? What finally clicked?
- Plan: What to build in Phase 2?
