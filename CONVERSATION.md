- `week-01-html-css/README.md` through `week-12-product-3/README.md` - Weekly details
- `portfolio/README.md` - Portfolio showcase setup

**Key Features:**
- Figma → Code translations for every concept
- Video resources for each week
- Project descriptions with deliverables
- Success metrics and checkpoints
- Troubleshooting guides

### 3. Version Control

```bash
✅ Git repo initialized
✅ All files committed
✅ Pushed to GitHub: https://github.com/jarincz/ClaudeLearning
✅ Remote configured
```

## Key Concepts Covered

### Your Superpower: Figma Knowledge Transfers to Code

| Figma | Code |
|---|---|
| Components | React components |
| Properties | Props |
| Variants | State & conditional rendering |
| Auto-layout | CSS Flexbox/Grid |
| Design tokens | CSS variables |
| Fill/Stroke | CSS colors/borders |

### Learning Path
- **Week 1-4:** Build 14+ portfolio projects (HTML, CSS, JS, React)
- **Week 5-8:** Full-stack development (Next.js, databases, AI)
- **Week 9-12:** Ship real products people use

### Daily Workflow
- Morning: 1 hour learning (video resources)
- Evening: 3 hours building (apply concepts)
- 20 hours/week weekday + 10 hours/week weekend = 30 hours/week

---

## Tools & Resources

### Essential Tools
- **VS Code** - Code editor
- **GitHub** - Version control
- **Node.js** - JavaScript runtime
- **Vercel** - Frontend deployment
- **Supabase** - Database

### Learning Resources
- **Kevin Powell** - HTML & CSS master
- **Web Dev Simplified** - Clear explanations
- **freeCodeCamp** - Comprehensive courses
- **React Docs** - Official reference
- **Claude Code** - Your pair programmer

---

## Your Advantages

✅ **Figma power user** - Think in components already
✅ **Design systems knowledge** - Understand architecture
✅ **User empathy** - Will build better products
✅ **Component thinking** - Maps directly to React

---

## Success Metrics

**Week 4:** 14+ projects deployed ✅
**Week 8:** Full-stack app with real users ✅
**Week 12:** 2-3 shipped products ✅

---

## Next Steps

1. **Start Week 1** - Begin with portfolio homepage
2. **Watch video resources** - Kevin Powell's HTML & CSS (primary resource)
3. **Build first site** - Convert your Figma portfolio to code
4. **Deploy to Vercel** - Share your first live website
5. **Share progress** - Post on Twitter/LinkedIn (accountability)

---

## Important Reminders

**Week 2 Reality Check:** JavaScript will feel hard. First 3 days are toughest. This is NORMAL. Push through - it clicks by Day 4-5.

**Consistency > Intensity:** Show up every day, even if just for 1 hour.

**Building > Tutorials:** Code more, watch less. Follow along with videos, don't just passively watch.

**Public Learning:** Share progress weekly. Build in public. Community helps.

**Ask Claude Code:** No question is too basic. Use Claude as your pair programmer daily.
