Each week folder has a detailed README with:
- Learning goals
- Video resources
- Figma → Code translations
- Project descriptions
- Success criteria

---

## Daily Workflow

1. **Open today's week README**
2. **Watch video resources** (1 hour)
3. **Build the project** (2-3 hours)
4. **Update CLAUDE.md** with what you learned (15 min)
5. **Push to GitHub** (5 min)

---

## Key Principle: You Already Think Like a Developer

Your Figma knowledge translates directly:

| Figma | Code |
|-------|------|
| Components | React components |
| Props | Component properties |
| Variants | State & conditional rendering |
| Auto-layout | CSS Flexbox/Grid |
| Design tokens | CSS variables |

**This is your superpower.** Use it.

---

## Resources

### Essential Tools
- **Code Editor:** VS Code
- **Deployment:** Vercel
- **Database:** Supabase
- **Version Control:** GitHub

### Learning Style
- **Video-first:** Follow along tutorials, don't just watch
- **Build-focused:** Code every single day
- **Public learning:** Share progress weekly

### When Stuck
1. Check the week's README for context
2. Ask Claude Code (it's your pair programmer)
3. Re-watch video sections
4. Search Stack Overflow
5. Read official docs

---

## Success Metrics

**Week 4:** 14 projects deployed ✅
**Week 8:** Full-stack app with users ✅
**Week 12:** 2-3 shipped products ✅

---

## Communication

### Your Buddy System
Find a learning partner. Weekly 30-min check-in on Sundays.

### Public Learning
Share weekly progress:
- Tweet about what you built
- Post screenshots
- Write about what clicked
- Document lessons learned

### Using Claude Code
Daily prompts:
- "Explain this React error"
- "Help me convert this design to code"
- "Debug this fetch() issue"
- "What's the best structure for this?"

---

## Important Notes

### Week 2 Reality Check
JavaScript Week will be hard. That's normal. First 3 days are toughest. Stick with it.

### When Behind Schedule
Extend Phase 1 instead of rushing. Better foundation beats rushing ahead.

### When Ahead of Schedule
Add React Native, testing, TypeScript, or open source contributions.
